the story so far
------
I am a *medicinae doctor* in Public Health. I studied at the Faculty of Medicine of University of Rome, *Sapienza*, where I graduated in 2014. I was not meant to do Public Health, actually. In 2012 I started attending the laboratory of clinical immunology of Rome general hospital *Umberto I* (the last year of medical studies in Italy is dedicated to a long – not paid – internship) and, in 2013, I moved to Paris and started to attend the laboratory of biotherapy and clinical research center. My thesis about the interaction of *B lymphocytes* and *regulatory T cells* (the well known "CD4+FOXP3+CD25+"!) come out (for a selected public) after almost 2 years of work, in March 2014. In the same year, I started my residency programme. I spent one year of my residency in Paris, I moved to Rouen (Upper Normandy), then I went back againg to Paris. I defended the thesis (*Parkinson disease in the women of a French cohort*) of my master degree in *epidemiology* in September 2018 and my second thesis in medicine (long story short: thesis are defended during the residency programme in France - no matter if you already hold one!) in October 2019. 

what is public health
------
Not easy to define. According to the [Springer Encyclopedia of Public Health](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-1-4020-5614-7_723), *Public Health is an empiric and multidisciplinary field whose goal is to assure conditions in which people can be healthy. While medicine mainly focuses on treating illness in separate individuals, it is the central goal of public health activities to increase health at the population level. [...] The success of public health depends on adhering to the basic rules of equity, partnerships, and social justice, as well as the mobilization of local, national, and international resources.* Public Health is a quite complex discipline with one purpose: healthy population.  

**what you do as public health specialist**  
As Public Health is an extremely wide discipline, residents tend to specialize in one of its branch. During the four years of my residency, I attended a master programme in epidemiology (*M2 Recherche en santé publique - épidémiologie*) at [Université Paris Sud](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en). So here I am. After a few months working in epidemiology and *biostatistics* during my residency at [INSERM](https://www.inserm.fr/) in Paris and [Rouen University Hospital](https://www.chu-rouen.fr/), here I am working as attending physician in the *Biostatistics and Clinical Research Unit* of [Caen University Hospital](https://www.chu-caen.fr/). 

**what do you do there**  
As statician-medical doctor, I work with fellow MDs in clinical trials and research projects carried out at the University Hospital of Caen. I also teach at the [University of Caen](http://www.unicaen.fr/).   

and what about the outer space?
------
Public Health is a multi-disciplinary speciality: the more you meet people, the more you learn. As resident, I enjoyed being part of the [European Network of Medical Residents in Public Health](https://www.euronetmrph.org) and [CLiSP](https://clisp.fr/). As a Public Health specialist with a deep interest in numbers, I loved being challenged by the conversations on Health Systems and Economics had during the [European Health Forum Gastein](https://www.ehfg.org/), attended thanks to *Young Forum Gastein scholarship*, and being involved in conversations around the [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) universe as community team member of [R Forwards](https://forwards.github.io/).
